### General Info to Know:
1. Install Node.js and Yarn on your machine
  * Node download can be found here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
  * Yarn download can be found here: https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/
2. Please use the Yarn equivalent of **npm install/uninstall** when adding modules so project dependencies get updated properly : )
3. We're using Yarn instead of npm because Yarn is faster and handles package version control across collaborators better
